# Knee Supporter

Knee Supporter App.

# SIH 2022 üèÜ
This repository contains the app that was built as a part of the hardware product designed to help the elder people with Knee pain. The mechanical design uses a Cam and Follower mechanism to add offset between the knee joint as we turn in the knee. This can communicate with the ESP32 Device connected to the Mechanical device over Bluetooth Classic and can display the required stats. Some other features include:
- Firebase Authentication
- Graph based HeartBeat display
- alerts on unusual health conditions such as high heartrate and humidity.
- Bluetooth Classic connection
